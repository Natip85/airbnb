    "neighborhood_overview": "The apartment is located in the famous district Sch\u00f6neberg between U stations Wittenbergplatz and Nollendorfplatz. In the roaring 1920s, Sch\u00f6neberg was the neighbourhood of artists and musicians of Berlin. The neighbourhood around Nollendorfplatz in particular was known for elaborate parties and a casual lifestyle. To this day, modern clubs like Goya build on the atmosphere of that time. Winterfeldplatz, which hosts the city's largest food market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, lies directly to the south. Around the square and on nearby side streets, there are plenty of cafes and bars. Another Place of interest is Sch\u00f6neberg town hall. After the division of Germany, it was the political centre of West Berlin. This is where Kennedy uttered the famous words, 'ich bin ein Berliner'. To the south of the town hall, the long Rudolf-Wilde park is a good option for a leisurely stroll. Sch\u00f6neberg has a good connection to the neighbouring districts. The U-Bahn lines U1, U2, U3, U4 and U7 go through",

One of the best things is that the apartment is basically next to the famous Tempelhofer Feld - an old airport which got turned into a crazy cool park where you can do all different kind of sports or just enjoy the grass and the nature and lie there or go for nice walks. If you are missing some trees just go to Volkspark Hasenheide, a 7-minute-walk from the flat and ideal for walks or relaxing if you need some rest from the vibrant city feeling.",

    "transit": "You can find everything you are looking for in walking distance. If you still want to leave the area it's only a 8-minute-walk to the U-Bahn U8 Boddinstra\u00dfe and you are in no time in e.g. Kreuzberg, Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg. To the Alexanderplatz its a 10 minute ride only! You also reach the Ringbahn- / circle-line-station Hermannstra\u00dfe in only 2 stops with the U8 (which takes you to the airport Sch\u00f6nefeld for example).",
    "access": "Apart from your spacious room, you have of course access to our kitchen with all its quality cooking facilities, a dishwasher, an espresso machine and a big table to sit on. There is also a bathroom with a washing machine, a dryer, a bathtub and fresh towels waiting for you :).  If you need things like an iron or a hairdryer or who knows what, just ask us. Of course there is also free WiFi in the flat. Enjoy sunny days on the rather big balcony which is attached to your room! Just feel at home!!",

We love traveling with our beloved camper, meeting new people, cooking, eating, listening to music, theatre, films, life in general :)!!! We are happy to being able to rent out one of the rooms in our 4-room flat to travellers from all around the world! Welcome!!!\r\n\r\nWir sind ein Paar um die 30 mit einer kleinen Tochter, die fast zwei ist. Am liebsten reisen wir mit unserem geliebten Camper durch Europa, allgemein freuen wir uns immer dar\u00fcber, neue Menschen kennenzulernen. Selber w\u00fcrden wir uns als unkompliziert und spontan beschreiben. Beruflich sind wir im Theater-, Film- und Literaturbetrieb t\u00e4tig. Der Schillerkiez ist die uns liebste Ecke Berlins und wir f\u00fchlen uns hier sehr heimisch. Wir freuen uns dar\u00fcber, Besucher aus aller Welt bei uns zu beherbergen!",

From Airport Sch\u00f6nefeld is about 35-40 min by public transport. Please take the Bus until underground-station \"Rudow\". The \"U7\" until \"Bayrischer Platz\" and then one station with the unterground \"U4\" to \"Viktoria-Luise-Platz\".  You can also take the \"S-Bahn\" until \"Innsbrucker-Platz\" and from there the \"U4\". But sometimes the S-Bahn is not driving. So I would take the tube.  A taxi is of course faster but much more expensive. I guess \u20ac35. Notice Board: In the room many flyers and information brochures are available on various aspects of the city. Many have been left behind by your predecessors. It would be nice if you added the collection and left your tourist brochures here if you do",
    "transit": "The U4 station \"Viktoria-Luise-Platz\" is 100m away and connects various subway lines and to the S-Bahn ring around the city center of Berlin. Nollendorfplatz is only one station (or 7-minute walk) away. The largest Berlin U-Bahn station, which connects four lines brings you eg the U2 to Potsdamer Platz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Museum Island. Or is it the U1 directly to Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain with their lively night life? For shopping enthusiasts, the KaDeWe and the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm at Wittenberg Platz are also only 10 minutes far. Or you just take the Metrobus M46, which runs every 10 min. driving off from the side street (Martin-Luther-Str.) to the Zoologischer Garten (Zoo) and the Southern Cross (S\u00fcdkreuz). Since many guests wish to explore Berlin by bicycle (Berlin has a very good network of cycle paths) There is a bike rental shop in a side street nearby.",
    "access": "In addition to fast Wi-Fi, the room has a television and a radio (+ extra radio with adapter for i-phones). Fresh linen and as many towels as are needed are of course available. The apartment has central heating. In the clean bathroom a hairdryer is available, and, if a guest wants to bathe, there are also various bath products that you are welcome to use.  The kitchen is fully equipped, with tea making facilities, a microwave, a toaster, an electric cooker with ceramic hob, a refrigerator, a dishwasher, a coffee maker, cooking utensils, and much more. Feel free to use whatever you need. Basic condiments and spices for cooking are of course also available. Everything necessary for baking is also there since I like to bake. A washing machine is also available; please ask me for assistance if you wish to use it. There is also a launderette in a neighboring street close by.",
    "interaction": "Many guests I see either rarely or not at all during their stay, since I myself often travel or the guests have a different time rhythm from my own. Otherwise, I am of course glad to provide tips on the best places in Berlin whenever wanted, depending on what the guest is interested in. Sometimes I can also offer a small city tour, but only when desired. It is important to me that the guest is left alone and only given information when it is wanted.",
    "house_rules": "A house rules there though and this is hanging out by the landlord in the stairwell, but in all previous guests this really was not necessary. My neighbors in the house are all very nice and that is why there has never been any problems so far also. I find it very pleasant to set up any rules, but to trust the guest. He should feel free and at home!",

Homero's an aerospace engineer and has already lived in Canada, the UK & several cities in Germany.\r\n\r\nHomero's an awesome cook and loves to prepare his Mexican masterpieces at home and I, well I generally stay away from the oven, my specialty is cleaning.. I'm a neat freak so we combine well together. \r\n\r\nWe love to travel ourselves, see interesting places, meet people with a different outlook on life and experience different cultures. \r\n\r\nWir sprechen auch Deutsch!\r\nHablamos espa\u00f1ol!\r\nJe parle fran\u00e7ais!\r\n\r\nWe're looking forward to meeting you!",
